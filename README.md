# Global Health Data Analysis

This project explores global health statistics to uncover trends in life expectancy, healthcare access, and regional disparities. The goal is to understand how health outcomes vary across countries and what factors might influence these differences.

## Dataset
The data used in this project was sourced from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/) and includes indicators like:
- Life expectancy
- Access to clean water
- Child mortality
- GDP per capita
- Healthcare spending

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
## Project Goals
- Clean and preprocess real-world health data
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualize key trends and comparisons across countries and continents
- Identify correlations between socioeconomic factors and health outcomes

## Key Insights
- Regions with higher GDP and health spending tend to have longer life expectancy
- Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest child mortality rates
- Access to clean water is still a major issue in many developing countries

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the Jupyter notebook: global_health_analysis.ipynb
3. Run the cells to see the analysis and visualizations
